Step 1: Obtain the Latest Go Binary

Visit https://golang.org/dl/ to check the latest stable release, or use a version recommended by your team. Here, we demonstrate installing Go 1.22.4 (as of June 2024):

curl -LO https://go.dev/dl/go1.22.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz

Step 2: Remove Any Previous Go Installation

Avoid residual path conflicts by removing older Go installations:

sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go

Step 3: Extract the Go Archive to /usr/local

sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.22.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz

Step 4: Configure Your PATH

To ensure Go binaries are globally accessible, augment your environment:

echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

Step 5: Verify Installation and Inspect Environment

go version

Expected output:

go version go1.22.4 linux/amd64

Check and document environment for troubleshooting and reproducibility:

go env
